        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p1 id="para">I’ve been called smart, innovative, hard working, thoughtful, and optimistic, however, I prefer to be called Austin. I’ve been told I remind people of a golden retriever, a Hobby Lobby version of Chris Evans, and Cameron Diaz. I enjoy cycling, hazy IPAs, and exploring with my partner.</p1>
